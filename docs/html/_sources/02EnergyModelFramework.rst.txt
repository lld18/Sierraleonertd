2. Energy model: Framework 
=======================================

This documentation has been created in order to provide an overview of OSeMOSYS-CR. Therefore, it presents the model structure, and gives a synthesis of the key assumptions of the model, regarding the numerical inputs used for the sets, parameters, and scenario building. First, in this section, we give an insight to the general framework of the model.

2.1 General model structure 
+++++++++

The Sierra Leonean energy sector is entirely modelled in OSeMOSYS. 

















2.2 Sets 
+++++++++

The sets are responsible for defining the structure of the model (i.e. temporal space, geographic space, elements of the system, etc.). In OSeMOSYS, the group of sets include: years, fuels, technologies, emissions and modes of operation. As is going to be further explained, the sets are characterised through parameters. These subsections present the sets that compose the current version of OSeMOSYS-SL.  

2.2.1 Year
---------

This corresponds to the period of analysis. For OSeMOSYS-SL it is from 2015 to 2050. However, the data from 2015 to 2023 is set according to historical information. 

2.2.2 Fuels
---------








































2.2.3 Technologies
---------












































2.2.4 Emissions
---------




































2.2.5 Mode of operation
---------



2.2.6 Region
---------

The model has a nationwide scope, therefore it only has one region: Sierra Leone (SL).
